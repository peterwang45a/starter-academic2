I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am advised by Prof. [Yuxi Fu](https://basics.sjtu.edu.cn/~yuxi/) and Dr. [Hongfei Fu](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~hongfeifu/). I am mainly interested in formal methods, aiming at proving system correctness by rigorous mathematical approaches. Currently, my focus is on program verification and model checking (for probabilistic/concurrent programs).
